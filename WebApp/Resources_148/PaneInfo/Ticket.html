  <h3>
    Ticket</h3>
  <p>
    The following describes the available selections for a given ticket:</p>
  <p>
    1) Name: Each ticket must have a name/description.&nbsp; This is typically the subject
    of the ticket.</p>
  <p>
    2) Ticket Type: Tickets can be classified as anything you want and depends on the "types" of tickets you have defined in your account.  See <a href="http://help.teamsupport.com/tickets-1/modify-ticket-types" target="_blank">here</a> for modifying ticket types.</p>
  <p>
    3) Status: The Status defines the current state of the ticket.&nbsp; Status types
    are customizable within the Admin section.
    Instead of simply having a predefined status for tickets such as &ldquo;open&rdquo;
    and &ldquo;closed&quot;, TeamSupport allows the user administrator(s) to define
    the possible status, as well as the next possible status based
    on the current status.</p>
  <p>
    4) Severity: The Severity of a ticket helps define what kind of attention is needed.&nbsp;
    Typical types are Low, Medium and High.&nbsp; Of course, these may also be customized
    by the user administrator(s) within the Admin section.</p>
  <p>
    5) Product (Enterprise Only): By defining the products provided by your company
    within the Products section, you will
    have the option to select the particular product in question with regards to the
    ticket.</p>
  <p>
    6) Assigned To: Assigns the ticket to a defined TeamSupport user.&nbsp; See the
    User section on how users are created and
    defined.</p>
  <p>
    7) Assigned Group:&nbsp; Like user assignment, you also have the option to assign
    a ticket to groups.&nbsp; Each user can be assigned to a group which may be used
    to determine a users function within the company.&nbsp; Examples would be &quot;Customer
    Service&quot;, &quot;Software Development&quot;, Quality Assurance&quot;, etc..&nbsp;
    When a ticket is created and assigned to a group, every member of the group is notified
    via email.&nbsp; Any individual who is part of a group may take ownership of a ticket
    at anytime.</p>
  <p>
    8) Customer:&nbsp; Defining who your customers are allows you to attach them to
    a ticket.&nbsp; You also have the option to attach multiple customers to a ticket.&nbsp;
    This is especially valuable when an issue has been identified and it impacts multiple
    customers.&nbsp; This allows Customer Service teams - as well as Sales teams to
    deal with all customers impacted by the issue.&nbsp; See the Customers section on how to define customers and contacts.
  </p>
  <p>
    9) Product Version (Enterprise only): One of the biggest differences between TeamSupport
    and the rest of the solutions on the market is understanding the importance of being
    able to track specific product versions to a customer and a ticket. The development/product
    management team can define every product and version within the Products section. By defining this information, you will have
    quick access to these versions from the pull down menu.</p>
  <p>
    10) Visible on Portal: An optional component to TeamSupport is the Customer Portal.&nbsp;
    By checking this box, your customers that have been given portal access can see
    the contents of the ticket.</p>
