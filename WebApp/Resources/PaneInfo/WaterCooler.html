  <h3>Welcome to the Water Cooler!</h3>
  <p>Designed to capture the various chatter that happens internally, the Water Cooler is a great internal social tool that allows anyone on your team to ask questions and get answers from peers.  Many times we have face to face conversations at someone's desk, cubicle or the break room.  If the nature of the discussion is something others can benefit from as well, post it in the Water Cooler and help each other out.</p>

  <p>This is also great for remote teams that cannot have face to face discussions.</p>

  <p>You can ask a question to the entire team, or direct your question to a specific <b>group</b>. </p>
