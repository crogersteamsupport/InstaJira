  <h3>
    Products</h3>
  <p>
    The product section is where you define all of your products and versions that you are supporting. As you can see, the design of TeamSupport makes it very easy to tell what products and versions you provide. You can easily see what tickets are associated with each product, version, and customer.
  </p>

  <p>
    The ability to link an issue to a particular product and version of that product is a unique feature of TeamSupport and one that adds a lot of power and flexibility.  Now you can track issues on a per-product basis and track specifically where customers are having problems.
  </p>

<p>Another nice feature of TeamSupport is that you can attach files to a product version - These attachments are available for download via the Advanced Portal, and this can be used to let your customers download the most recent versions of your software directly from the Portal.</p>
