  <h3>
    Knowledge Base</h3>
  <p>
    This section lists all tickets that have been added to the Knowledge Base. Any ticket can be assigned to the Knowledge Base which lets your internal users have a place to reference common issues.  If the ticket is marked as "visible to customers" then your customers can view the tickets either via the <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.teamsupport.com/documentation/1/en/topic/knowledge-base-setup">Public Knowledge base</a></b> or the <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.teamsupport.com/documentation/1/en/topic/advanced-portal-default-settings">Advanced Portal</a></b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Knowledge base is also a great place to segregate and display helpful information such as how to configure products or various protocols that should be followed.
