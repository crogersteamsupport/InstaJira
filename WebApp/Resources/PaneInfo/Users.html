  <h3>
    Users</h3>
  <p>
    The User section is where all TeamSupport users are added and defined. Here we can see a list of users, how many tickets they have open, and any status messages they have listed. You can also see what group each user is a part of.
  </p>

<p>Note that this section is where you define your internal TeamSupport users, NOT where you manage your customers - You do that in the "Customers" section.</p>
