    TeamSupport offers an integrated team Calendar solution in order to provide extended collaboration across your organization. The TeamSupport Calendar can be used to display Ticket Due Dates, Reminders, and to add personal or team events such as Projects dates, Onsite Customer visits, User Vacations, Support Rotation schedules, and much more! Additionally, the real power of the TeamSupport Calendar is when you make associations to Tickets, Users, Companies, Groups, and Products.
