<h3>Community</h3>
<p>Communities, sometimes called forums, let end-users interact with each other as
  well as company support specialists through TeamSupport’s Customer Portal. They
  provide the enterprise with a means to notify customers, provide progress updates,
  solicit feedback, and even let users help to analyze and solve problems.</p>
<p>Communities are a venue where everyone can share ideas, experiences and gained
  knowledge with no limit to the number of exchanges and collaborations.</p>
<p>Posts are integrated directly with TeamSupport tickets so support staff can keep-up
  with discussion threads and customer communications.</p>
