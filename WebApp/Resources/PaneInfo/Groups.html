  <h3>
    Groups</h3>
  <p>
    Groups are a very powerful function in TeamSupport. When a user is a member of a
    group, and a ticket is assigned to that group but not assigned to an individual,
    all members of that group get notified.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can create as many groups as you like. A user can be a member of multiple groups
    as well. Typical groups may be support, level 2 support, product development, quality
    assurance, etc. Once the groups are created, simply assign the correct people to
    these groups. When a ticket is created, but the creator does not know the specific
    individual to assign the ticket to, they can simply assign it to the correct group
    - All members of that group will be notified, and any of them can take ownership
    on the ticket.
