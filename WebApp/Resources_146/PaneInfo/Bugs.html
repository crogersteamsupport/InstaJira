  <h3>
    Bugs</h3>
  <p>
    This grid displays all of the Bug tickets. A Bug is an error, flaw, mistake, failure,
    fault or “undocumented feature” in a product that prevents it from behaving as intended.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a customer reports a bug, TeamSupport makes it simple for you to change the
    classification and assign the bug ticket to the individual(s) who can address it.
    Once the bug is fixed, the ticket can be assigned to someone else on your team who
    can close the loop with the customer.
