  <h3>
    Customers</h3>
  <p>
    The Customers tab is where you can define who your customers are, what products
    they are using, and attach important files and notes.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can easily see, what specific tickets have been assigned to each customer. When
    they contact you for help, you know everything you need to know in order to provide
    them with a great experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Add custom fields to better define specific information abbot your customer, such
    as warranty status or contract expiration. Add as many custom fields as you require.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also create SLA's and assign them to your customers. SLA configuration may
    be found in the Admin section of TeamSupport.
