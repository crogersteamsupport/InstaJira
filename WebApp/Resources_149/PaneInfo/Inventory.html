<h3>Inventory</h3>
  <p>TeamSupport's Inventory module allows you to track physical inventory items which have been shipped to customers.</p>
  <p>There are three tabs within the Inventory module:</p>
<h3>Assigned Inventory</h3>
  <p>This sections shows all hardware which is currently assigned to a customer.  You can search and filter to see specific items using the filter bars at the top of the grid.  Selecting an item and pressing the "Edit Asset" button will bring up the dialog to be able to change information about that asset.  The "Return Asset" button will ship an item from a customer to the Warehouse.
  </p>
<h3>Warehouse (unassigned) Inventory</h3>
  <p>The Warehouse is a list of all the assets which are not currently shipped but that are available to ship.  In this section you can create a new asset, ship an asset to a customer, edit it, or assign it to the Junkyard.
  </p>
<h3>Junkyard</h3>
  <p>
  The Junkyard is where assets that are no longer functioning are placed.  This allows you to keep track of historical assets but in a place where they cannot be shipped to customers or otherwise used.
