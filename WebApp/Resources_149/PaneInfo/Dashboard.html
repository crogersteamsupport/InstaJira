    Dashboard</h3>

    Once you have created tickets, the pie chart will show you how many tickets you
    currently have open. You will also see the 25 most recently modified tickets,
    the most active Customers in the last 5 days, recently added Knowledge base tickets
    and unassigned group tickets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each box can be moved around or minimized to your liking. Once you have the layout
    the way you want it, press the "Save Layout" button.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also open any ticket from the dashboard by clicking the blue folder icon
    located next to the ticket name in the grid.
