  <h3>
    Issues</h3>
  <p>
    This grid displays all Issue tickets. An issue is something that has been reported
    internally or externally, but has not been identified as a bug or a feature. A good
    example of an issue would be operator error. Issues can be passed from person to
    person or group to group - such as "level 1 support", "escalation team" and so on.
