To setup dtSearch, copy dten600.dll and dtengine64.dll to your windows system directory. (C:\Windows\System32)
In your projects, add a reference to the dtSearchNetApi3.dll.
Use dtSearchNetApi3.dll.32 for a 32 bit OS or dtSearchNetApi3.dll.64 for a 64 bit OS.  Be sure to remove the number at the end.
